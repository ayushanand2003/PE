    <h2>A forest is made up of many layers. <br> The main layers of all forest types are the forest floor, the understory, and the canopy.<br> The emergent layer, above the canopy, exists in tropical rainforests. <br>Each layer has a different set of plants and animals, depending upon the availability of sunlight, moisture, and food</h2>
